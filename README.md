# MCWorldManager

a thing for importing, exporting, and just managing Minecraft Java Edition worlds

totally didn't just make this because i got tired of hearing people ask how to do this one very basic thing about minecraft

### [Download](https://github.com/Canary-Prism/MCWorldManager/releases/)

I'm assuming you know how to use GitHub. If not then here:

### Download Steps

1. Click above link
2. Find latest release
3. Find "Assets" Section
4. Click the "MCWorldManager-x.y.z.jar" file

### Notice

This program uses Java 22 bc i'm weird like that  
(i did however resist the temptation to use preview features so that this remains double-clickable and so somewhat idiot friendly)

#### [Here's a handy link](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=22)

(it's for Temurin bc nobody likes oracle)
